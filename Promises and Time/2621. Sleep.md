# 2621. Sleep

Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

Note that minor deviation from millis in the actual sleep duration is acceptable.

## Notes

Just more learning of the return-promise concept. I am learning more and more about arrow functions and async functions so this one wasn't that hard.
