# 2727. Is Object Empty

Given an object or an array, return if it is empty.

An empty object contains no key-value pairs.
An empty array contains no elements.
You may assume the object or array is the output of JSON.parse.

## Notes

Also could just use "return Object.keys(obj).length === 0", duh.
Anyways, this reminds me of Python dictionaries, so I understand the whole concept of objects and etc.
