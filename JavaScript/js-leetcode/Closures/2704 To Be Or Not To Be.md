# 2704. To Be Or Not To Be

Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.

toBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values === each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error "Not Equal".
notToBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values !== each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error "Equal".

## Notes

Very stupid, don't quite grasp why and what " toBe: (cVal) => " or " notToBe: (cVal) => " is. JS is quite a silly language, and the way it handles functions and objects bothers me.
This is supposed to be easy? I feel dumb
