## Notes

These notes serve as a general conclusion for the entire Arrays 101 course, rather than being specific to the problems in the final section.

My key takeaways from the course are as follows:

- My techniques for searching algorithms within arrays still need refinement; this is an area for further study.
- I learned a great deal about using pointers and managing indices effectively.
- My overall problem-solving skills for LeetCode-style questions are gradually improving.
- I need to better organize my LeetCode repositories for clarity and ease of use.
