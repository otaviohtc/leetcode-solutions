## Notes

The first problem is a tad bit silly, I just kinda copied what the problem statement said, and it just worked, I think because it's a simple problem.

Now, the second one was a headache, that mountain array stuff is really difficult to grasp and I had to search all around for a good explanation and break down of the problem.
