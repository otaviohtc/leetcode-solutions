## Notes

The first problem is quite simple, I just had some trouble with the implementation, but I immediately knew the logic of what I had to do.

The second one was a bit funny because I already had done it properly using in-place operations in the 'Deleting Items From an Array'.

The third problem was tricky, but I managed to understand the logic with the help and code of the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZ7nmouLTI. 

The sortArrayByParity one was pretty similar to the moveZeroes one, no problems.

Tthe removeElements is the same as the removeDuplicated, and by that I mean that I already had done this problem before in the other course.
