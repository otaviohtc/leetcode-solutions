# 2634. Filter Elements from Array

Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.

The fn function takes one or two arguments:

arr[i] - number from the arr
i - index of arr[i]
filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.

## Notes

Very similar to the 2635. Apply Transform Over Each Element in Array, but this one has the if-statement to check condition in the function. Is a bit confusing but it works?
